# MeloTTS ‚Äî Maintained & Easy-to-Use Fork üõ†Ô∏è

This project is an independently maintained fork of the original [MeloTTS](https://github.com/myshell-ai/MeloTTS) by [Wenliang Zhao](https://github.com/wl-zhao), [Xumin Yu](https://github.com/yuxumin), and [Zengyi Qin](https://github.com/Zengyi-Qin).  
The original work is licensed under the MIT License, and we thank the authors for their excellent research and contributions.

While the original MeloTTS is an impressive research project, this fork focuses on **making it simple to run and integrate** ‚Äî with a working Docker image, included UI, and API support.

It‚Äôs designed so that you can:
- Pull the Docker image
- Run it instantly
- Start synthesizing speech via UI or API without hunting down dependencies

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:**  This project is maintained for usability and convenience by a single developer (with a different primary tech stack).  
It is **not** a production-hardened system and may require additional work for deployment in critical environments.

‚úÖ **Offline Mode:** Supported ‚Äî provided that models are baked into the Docker image or mounted via a volume.  
If running in a fully offline environment, ensure all required model files are available locally before starting the container.

ü§ù **Contributions Welcome:** If you find bugs, have ideas, or want to improve things, feel free to submit issues or pull requests. Every bit of help makes this project better for everyone.
